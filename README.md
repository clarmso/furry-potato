## Prompt

The **Productotron 3000** is comprised of 1 screen, with several features:

- Display a catalog of products
- Create a new product
- Edit an existing product
- Delete an existing product

Your task is to take this basic CRUD application and ensure that it is tested properly with integration tests using Cypress.

You can ask any question beforehand and during about requirements, expectations, unclear goals or anything else that isn't clear; as with any project: [Ask Us](mailto:ash@cubesoftware.com&cc=alejandro@cubesoftware.com&cc=jason@cubesoftware.com&subject=Question%20about%20code%20challenge).
Someone should get back to you soon, any time, any day.

We expect you to do this on your own without help from anyone else. Answers are not found online. You'll be questioned about choices you made in testing this application.

We understand that this prompt may be seem open-ended; this assessment is an opportunity to show your style of testing an application. We have left this prompt open in order to not limit you in your submission as well as to foster communication. You can think of this project as a untested client application where you have just been hired on as a QA Engineer.

You may also notice that there is no mention of cypress in the source code. You are to install and setup Cypress yourself.

Other than that, you can get it done however you see fit. Show off as much or as little as you want. We'll talk soon! Good luck.
